# SHVFeedthroughFilter
Coaxial feedthrough filter that mounts on an SHV bulkhead.
Uses commercially available parts to make a high voltage filter that fits in a standard SHV bulkhead connection.

Connector is TE Connectivity AMP Connectors 5225059-3

Resistors are axial lead able to handle the high voltage while the sides of the resistor body are near ground, such as Ohmite MOX112523*
This series of resistor is highly recommend due to the low (0.25 pF) capacitance even though a shorter resistor would fit.
If the filter is used for a significant current inductors must be used instead. 
This filter was designed for use biasing cryogenic solid state detectors, which have very low leakage current.
Whatever the series component is it should fit inside the cable end of the connector. Some resistors may require sanding down slightly to fit.

Capacitors are 6kV 2225 package, such as Vishay Vitramon HV2225*

The center piece for the capacitors to solder to is a brass standoff, 5.5 mm hex diameter 1/4 inch tall.

The tube is a 0.686 inch ID brass or copper tube. A 3/4 inch 0.032 inch wall tube works and is common.

The other end can be another SHV connector, HV pigtail, whatever is desired. 
For a pigtail recommend capping the tube with a 3/4 inch OD brass or copper washer soldered to the tube and sealing the gap around the cable with epoxy.

The SHV pin should be placed on the axial lead of the resistor and up against the resistor body. This will allow apply sufficient force to fully insert the pin.

Recommend filling the tube with silicone oil and sealing the fill port with Kapton tape. The oil will leak out the pin on the SHV connector if not sealed.
Recommend sealing around the pin with some slow curing high viscosity epoxy that has been degassed using a centrifuge or vacuum.
Place epoxy around base of pin where it meets resistor and keep it positioned so it does flow along pin until after inserted into connector. 
Epoxy only needs to seal in oil, not provide high voltage insulation.
